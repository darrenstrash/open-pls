[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/darrenstrash/open-pls.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/darrenstrash/open-pls)

The purpose of this package is to (attempt) to reproduce the results of the following two papers:

*Phased local search for the maximum clique problem*,  
**Wayne Pullan**,  
Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 12 (3), pp. 303–323, 2006  
[doi:10.1007/s10878-006-9635-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10878-006-9635-y)

and

*Optimisation of unweighted/weighted maximum independent sets and minimum vertex covers*,  
**Wayne Pullan**,  
Discrete Optimization, 6 (2), pp. 214–219, 2009  
[doi:10.1016/j.disopt.2008.12.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disopt.2008.12.001)

In addition to providing an open implementation of the PLS algorithm, this software provides exact reproducibility of experimental results using PLS in the paper:

*Temporal Map Labeling: A New Unified Framework with Experiments*,  
**L. Barth, B. Niedermann, M. Nöllenburg, and D. Strash**,  
Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2016)  
[arXiv:1609.06327](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06327)

For the version of this software that exactly reproduces the results from the above paper, download [v1.0](https://github.com/darrenstrash/open-pls/releases/tag/v1.0)

###This package includes:

 - C++ code for phased local search, to compute an approximate:
   - maximum (unweighted) clique,
   - maximum weight clique,
   - maximum (unweighted) independent set, or
   - maximum weight independent set.
 - Converters to extract the graph and weights from a graphml file and convert to the  METIS format and to a text file storing node weights
 - A .graphml data file for testing (see ./data)

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

### Version
1.0beta

### Building

First, make sure you have clang 7.3.0 or g++ 5.3, then execute

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/darrenstrash/open-pls.git
$ cd open-pls
$ make
```

### Running
```sh
$ ./bin/pls --algorithm=<mc|mwc|mis|mwis> [--weighted] [--use-weight-file] --input-file=<input graph in METIS format> [--timeout=<timeout in seconds>] [--random-seed=<integer random seed>]
```

or

```sh
$ ./run.sh
```

to convert the graphml file in ./data to the appropriate format and run the Maximim Weight Independent Set algorithm (mwis).

### Graph Format

First, note that loops and directed edges are not supported, and could lead to errors.

Currently, one format is supported:

 - **The unweighted METIS format**: Which consists of

   `<# vertices> <# edges> 1`

   followed by `<# vertices>` lines of space-separated vertices,  where the `i`-th line consists of 
   all neighbors of `i`. All vertices range from `1` to `<# vertices>`

For weights, a separate file must be provided in the same directory with your METIS graph, with the name <METIS file>.weights

 - This is a file consisting of one weight per line, where line *i* indicates the weight for vertex *i-1*
